'timer' :: number of seconds between each image transition
'order' :: how you want your images displayed. choose either 'sequential' or 'random'
'looping' :: if the slide show is in sequential mode, this stops the show at the last image (use 'yes' for looping, 'no' for not)
'fadeTime' :: velocity of image crossfade. Increment for faster fades, decrement for slower. Approximately equal to seconds.
'xpos' :: _x position of all loaded clips (0 is default)
